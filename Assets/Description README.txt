For this assignment I did a simple animation that shows a happy blue ball rolling into frame while a yellow cube sits in the corner. 
The blue ball suddenly begins to jump around in joy as the yellow cube slowly gets closer and closer to it. Just as the ball is about to
land the yellow moves in its way causing the ball to get outta control falling off the plane. Suddenly the ball bounces back as its now red
and becoming larger as the cube moves away.

For this assignment I focused on the animation principles of squash and stretch, staging, and anticipation while I try to convey the emotions
of happiness and anger.
